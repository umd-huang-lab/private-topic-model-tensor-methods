We provide an end-to-end differentially pri- vate spectral algorithm for learning LDA, based on matrix/tensor decompositions, and establish theoretical guarantees on util- ity/consistency of the estimated model pa- rameters. The spectral algorithm consists of multiple algorithmic steps, named as “edges”, to which noise could be injected to obtain differential privacy. We identify subsets of edges, named as “configurations”, such that adding noise to all edges in such a subset guarantees differential privacy of the end-to-end spectral algorithm. We character- ize the sensitivity of the edges with respect to the input and thus estimate the amount of noise to be added to each edge for any required privacy level. We then character- ize the utility loss for each configuration as a function of injected noise. Overall, by com- bining the sensitivity and utility characteri- zation, we obtain an end-to-end differentially private spectral algorithm for LDA and iden- tify the corresponding configuration that out- performs others in any specific regime. We are the first to achieve utility guarantees un- der the required level of differential privacy for learning in LDA. Overall our method sys- tematically outperforms differentially private variational inference.
